  algorithm: cubist
  arguments:
    max_rules: 500
    committee_members: 2
    unbiased: False
    max_categories: 5000
    target_transform: standardise
#    bootstrap: 200

    auto: False
    neighbors: 5
    calc_usage: True
    print_output: False
#    trees: 10
#    parallel: True

# neighbors: int, number of nearest neighbors to be used (1-9)
# nearest-neighbor model: predicts the target value of a new case by finding
# the n most similar cases in the training data,
# and averaging their target values.

# max_categories: number of max categories in categorical data

# max_rules: use this to control overfitting (int: 1-1000000)

# committee_members: number of committees to use (int: 1-100)

# outdir: directory where intermediate model files are stored

# trees: number of cubist jobs, trees X committee_memebers will be the total
# number of trees

# extrapolation: allowed max deviation of predictions from
# training targets float between 0-100.

# bootstrap: use bootstarp (%) to generate samples from input data

# sampling: random sampling expressed in % terms to be  used during training.
# defaults to 70. If sampling is is chosen very close to 100%,
# the trees constructed will be more and more similar

# parallel: train cubist jobs in parallel

# unbiased: whether to train unbiased trees. Use unbiased=True for more skewed
# target distribution

# composite_model: Use rule based model or composite model?
# composite_model=True improves on rule based models, but in addition
# does the equivalent of krigging.

# auto: let cubist decide whether to use rule based or composite model.
# Cubist derives from the training data a heuristic estimate of the accuracy
# of each type of model, and chooses the form that appears more accurate.
# The derivation of these estimates requires quite a lot of computation,
# so leaving the decision to Cubist can result in a noticeable increase
# in the time required to build a model.

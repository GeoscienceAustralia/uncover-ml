Command Line Interface
======================

UncoverML is controlled by submitting a YAML configuration file to a
series of commands. For example, to run a learn -> predict workflow:

.. code:: console
    
    uncoverml learn config.yaml
    uncoverml predict config.yaml

UncoverML has several command line options available: 

.. program-output:: uncoverml
    :ellipsis: 20

See the :ref:`workflows` for examples on using these commands.

Running on HPC

In the ``scripts`` directory of the repository there are some example 
configs and an example script, ``job_submit_example.sh``, to assist 
with launching batch jobs over multiple nodes with PBS.
